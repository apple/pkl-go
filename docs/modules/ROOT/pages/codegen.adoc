= Code generation

:fn-runtime-value: footnote:disclaimer[The runtime value, not an instance].

Pkl code may turn into Go code by way of code generation.

== Running code generation

Code generation is done through the `pkl-gen-go` binary. To install:

[source,bash]
----
go install github.com/apple/pkl-go/cmd/pkl-gen-go@latest
----

Once installed, Go may be generated from Pkl:

[source,bash]
----
pkl-gen-go config/AppConfig.pkl
----

== Configuring the code generator

Options may be provided to the code generator either using CLI flags, or using a settings file.

[[settings-file]]
=== Settings file

The settings file is a Pkl file that amends module https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang/current/GeneratorSettings/index.html[`package://pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang@<VERSION>#/GeneratorSettings.pkl`].

By default, the code generator will look for a `generator-settings.pkl` file residing in the current working directory.
If found, it is used to configure the code generator.

The settings file may also be set using the `--generator-settings` flag.

=== Base path

The base path setting determines the relative path in which files get written to the working directory. It also acts
as a filter to skip codegen for any modules that are external to the project.

For example, if a Pkl module corresponds to Go package `github.com/myorg/myproject/appconfig`, and the base path is `github.com/myorg/myproject`, the generated files are placed into output directory `appconfig/`.

If a base path is not explicitly set, `pkl-gen-go` will also look for a `go.mod` file in the current working directory and use the Go module name as the base path.

If the base path cannot be determined, the full package path is written to the current working directory.

The base path may be set in the settings file, and also via the `--base-path` CLI flag.

NOTE: If the determined package name is not prefixed by the base path, it is skipped from code generation.

=== Package mappings

During codegen, the generator requires a mapping from a Pkl module name to a Go package name.

In normal cases, this should be provided using the `@go.Package` annotation. However, there are times when this is infeasible, for example, if the Pkl module is external to the project. For these situations, mappings can be provided using the https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/releases/download/v{version}/pkl.golang/current/GeneratorSettings/index.html#packageMappings[packageMappings] property in the settings file, or using the `--mapping` CLI flag.

=== Struct tags

By default, all struct fields receive a `pkl` tag. Additional tags can be configured either on a per-property basis, or globally for all properties.

To configure tags on a per-property basis, use the https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang/current/go/Field.html[`@go.Field`] annotation on a property.

To configure tags globally for all properties, use the https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang/current/GeneratorSettings/index.html#structTags[`structTags`] property the xref:settings-file[generator settings file].

Here is an example for setting struct tags for a single property:

[source,pkl]
----
@go.Field {
  structTags {
    ["toml"] = "%{name},omitempty" // <1>
  }
}
firstName: String
----
<1> Add `toml:"firstName,omitempty"` as a struct tag

To share struct tag settings across multiple properties, define a child class of `go.Field`.

[source,pkl]
----
class TomlField extends go.Field {
  structTags {
    ["toml"] = "%{name},omitempty"
  }
}

@TomlField
firstName: String

@TomlField
lastName: String
----

== How Pkl is turned into Go

=== Basic types

The below table describes how Pkl types are mapped into Go types.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Pkl type | Go type
|`Null`
|`nil`

|`Boolean`
|`bool`

|`String`
|`string`

|`Int`
|`int`

|`Int8`
|`int8`

|`Int16`
|`int16`

|`Int32`
|`int32`

|`UInt`
|`uint`

|`UInt8`
|`uint8`

|`UInt16`
|`uint16`

|`UInt32`
|`uint32`

|`Float`
|`float64`

|`Number`
|`float64`

|`List<T>`
|`[]T`

|`Listing<T>`
|`[]T`

|`Map<K, V>`
|`map[K]V`

|`Mapping<K, V>`
|`map[K]V`

|`Set<T>`
|`map[T]struct{}`

|`Pair<A, B>`
|`*pkl.Pair[A, B]`

|`Dynamic`
|`*pkl.Object`

|`DataSize`
|`*pkl.DataSize`

|`Duration`
|`*pkl.Duration`

|`IntSeq`
|`*pkl.IntSeq`

|`Class` {fn-runtime-value}
|`*pkl.Class`

|`TypeAlias` {fn-runtime-value}
|`*pkl.TypeAlias`

|`Any`
|`any`

|`unknown`
|`any`

|Unions (`A\|B\|C`)
|`any` footnote:[Unions of string literals turn into enums if defined via a `typealias`. For reference, see xref:enums[enums].]
|===

NOTE: `pkl.Class`, `pkl.TypeAlias`, `pkl.IntSeq` and `pkl.Pair` only exist for compatibilty purposes because they are possible Pkl runtime values.

=== Classes

Classes turn into a variation of structs and interfaces, depending on inheritance. Interfaces get generated because Go cannot model polymorphism with structs alone (e.g. a value that is a `Dog` struct is not assignable when an `Animal` struct is expected).

When generating interfaces, a getter is generated for every property by prefixing `Get` to the property name.

The below table describes how classes get generated.

|===
| Pkl class | Go interface | Go struct
| `class Person`
| <none>
| `type Person struct`

| `open class Person`
| `type Person interface`
| `type PersonImpl struct`

| `abstract class Person`
| `type Person interface`
| <none>

| `class Person extends Being`
| `type Person interface` footnote:[interface `Being` is embedded]
| `type PersonImpl struct` footnote:[struct `BeingImpl` is embedded]
|===

In the case of inheritance, the parent's struct and interface are embedded.

[[enums]]
=== Enums

If a typealias is defined as a union of string literals, it is turned into a new type backed by `string`. Each member of the union is generated as its own constant.

The new type is placed into a subpackage of the module's mapped Go package.

For example, the following Pkl code:

[source,pkl]
----
typealias City = "San Francisco"|"Cupertino"|"London"
----

Turns into something like this:

[source,go]
----
package city

type City string

const (
	SanFrancisco City = "San Francisco"
	Cupertino City    = "Cupertino"
	London City       = "London"
)
----

If the names of the determined constants conflicts due to normalization rules, an enum is not generated, and a `string` type is instead inlined into the usage locations.

If a typealias isn't a union of string literals, its resolved type is inlined into the usage locations.

NOTE: The Pkl type `nothing` is ignored when a member of a union. Therefore, `typealias City = nothing|"San Francisco"|"Cupertino"|"London"` is still considered an enum.

[[name-conflicts]]
== Resolving name conflicts

When turning Pkl names into Go names, the code generator follows these rules:

1. Any non-letter and non-digit characters get stripped, and each proceding letter gets capitalized.
2. If a name does not start with a latin alphabet character, prefix with `N`.
3. Capitalize so they get exported.

As a result, it is possible that two names collide and turn into the same Go name.
To resolve these conflicts, the https://pkl-lang.org/package-docs/pkg.pkl-lang.org/pkl-go/pkl.golang/current/go/Name.html[`@go.Name`]
annotation must be used on at least one of these declaractions so the resulting names are distinct.

For example:

[source,pkl]
----
@go.Name { value = "MyCoolApplication" }
class My_Application

class MyApplication
----
