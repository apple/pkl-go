* Support for Pkl 0.26

=== Fixes

* Make the loading of `generator-settings.pkl` observe the CLI's `--cache-dir` for air-gapped use.
* Fix decoding of sets when input type is any.

=== Miscellaneous

* Improved performance and clarity of version comparison.
* Fix unhandled error in the evaluator manager.
* Reduced lock contention in `atomicRandom`.

[[release-0.7.0]]
== 0.7.0 (2024-06-06)

=== Additions

* Add a way to set the cache dir when running `pkl-gen-go`.
    - Add `--cache-dir` flag to the CLI.
    - Add `cacheDir` property to `GeneratorSettings.pkl`.

=== Fixes

* Correct typos in some doc comments.
* Address a possible race condition that prevents correctly closing the evaluator.
* Gracefully shut down the `pkl` child process. The process is now given five seconds to shut down before forcefully terminated.
* Change pkl-gen-go to handle path separators correctly on Windows.
* Fix unix file permissions when writing files.
* Correctly resolve pkl-gen-go's `--project-dir` flag when given a relative path.

=== Miscellaneous

* Fix typos.
* Update doc comments on modules to prevent godoc from processing license headers as documentation.

=== Breaking changes

* `type DurationUnit` and `type DataSizeUnit` are now backed by `int64`, to avoid possible int overflow issues on 32 bit systems.
* `EvaluatorOptions.ProjectDir` is renamed to `EvaluatorOptions.ProjectBaseURI` to be forwards-compatible with scheme-agnostic projects coming in Pkl 0.27.
