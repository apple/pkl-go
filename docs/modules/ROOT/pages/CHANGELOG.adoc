[[release-0.11.0]]
== 0.11.0 (2025-07-28)

=== Additions

* Add support for interop with `Bytes` introduced in Pkl 0.29 (https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/pull/150[#150]).
** `Bytes` maps to type `[]byte` during codegen.
** Add methods `Evaluator.EvaluateOutputBytes` and `Evaluator.EvaluateOutputFilesBytes`.
* Add support for HTTP rewrites (https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/pull/147[#147]).
+
As part of this change, this adds field `EvaluatorOptions.Rewrites` and `ProjectEvaluatorSettingsHttp.Rewrites`.
* Add method `pkl.RegisterStrictMapping` (https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/pull/136[#136]).

=== Changes

* Change `pkl-gen-go` to generate non-pointers for object types (https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/pull/136[#136]).
+
Currently, `pkl-gen-go` will generate pointers for object types (values backed by a Go struct).
At the same time, it will also generate pointers for Pkl nullable types.
As a result, it's not possible to tell whether an object is nullable or not just by looking at the Go type.
To address this, all object types are generated as their plain type, without pointers.
+
Code generated with older versions of `pkl-gen-go` will continue to work as-is.
+

* Incorrect conversion logic in `DataSize.ToUnit` method (https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/issues/145[#145]).

=== Breaking Changes

* `pkl-gen-go` now requires Pkl 0.29.

[[release-0.8.0]]
== 0.8.0 (2024-07-04)

=== Additions

* Support for Pkl 0.26

=== Fixes

* Make the loading of `generator-settings.pkl` observe the CLI's `--cache-dir` for air-gapped use.
* Fix decoding of sets when input type is any.

=== Miscellaneous

* Improved performance and clarity of version comparison.
* Fix unhandled error in the evaluator manager.
* Reduced lock contention in `atomicRandom`.
* Use `path.join` to make the resolution of `PklProject` files platform independent.

=== Breaking changes

* `NewProjectEvaluator` now interprets `PklProject` files with the same configuration as the modules in the project.

[[release-0.7.0]]
== 0.7.0 (2024-06-06)

=== Additions

* Add a way to set the cache dir when running `pkl-gen-go`.
    - Add `--cache-dir` flag to the CLI.
    - Add `cacheDir` property to `GeneratorSettings.pkl`.

=== Fixes

* Correct typos in some doc comments.
* Address a possible race condition that prevents correctly closing the evaluator.
* Gracefully shut down the `pkl` child process. The process is now given five seconds to shut down before forcefully terminated.
* Change pkl-gen-go to handle path separators correctly on Windows.
* Fix unix file permissions when writing files.
* Correctly resolve pkl-gen-go's `--project-dir` flag when given a relative path.

=== Miscellaneous

* Fix typos.
* Update doc comments on modules to prevent godoc from processing license headers as documentation.

=== Breaking changes

* `type DurationUnit` and `type DataSizeUnit` are now backed by `int64`, to avoid possible int overflow issues on 32 bit systems.
* `EvaluatorOptions.ProjectDir` is renamed to `EvaluatorOptions.ProjectBaseURI` to be forwards-compatible with scheme-agnostic projects coming in Pkl 0.27.
